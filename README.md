# To-Do and Notes App
A To-Do and Notes Application is a task management and note-taking application to help users stay organized and manage their day-to-day tasks. This app brings together the power of two applications, a To-Do tasks manager, and a Notes manager, into a single app so that the user does not have to migrate to different application for trivial tasks. This application uses the power of Android's Room Persistence Library to store persistent data of the application. Some important functionalities like reminders for incomplete tasks, copy to clipboard have also been implemented in this application.  
Note: This application is currently only available for Android. iOS and other OS are not supported.

Features of To-Do and Notes Application:  
1. Add, modify and delete to-do tasks and notes: The application gives you the option to add, modify and remove to-do tasks and notes. You can edit tasks and notes if you want to change them.
2. Reminders with alarms: The application notifies you of deadlines you set for your to-do tasks.
3. Persistent Storage: The application uses the power of Android's Room Persistence Library to store app data like tasks and notes so that data is stored even when the application is not running. The application also uses Android's SharedPreferences for trivial information about the user of the application.
4. Copy to clipboard: The application gives you a context menu when you short-press on a to-do task or note but it copies the task info or note to clipboard when you long-press on a to-do task or note.
